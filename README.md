# leetcode-topical
Curation of great Leetcode questions, categorized by topic. The criteria for curation is that questions must be valuable, and not difficult for the sake of being difficult.

The best questions are those that: (1) can be solved in a variety of ways, possibly with different efficiencies (with the help of various data structures); (2) require common, useful, and reusable techniques; (3) have real-world use cases.

The worst questions are those that require familiarity with an uncommon technique to solve.

Essentially, this is a curation of questions that I personally use to prepare for technical interviews.
